## 📝 Practice Problems

**Inelastic Collision**: A 2.0 kg object is at rest on a frictionless surface when it is hit by a 3.0 kg object moving at 8.0 m/s. The two objects stick together after they collide.

* What is the speed of the combination after the collision?
* What is the total kinetic energy of the combination before the collision?
* What is the total kinetic energy of the combination after the collision?
* Why are the energies different? Have we violated conservation of energy?

**Elastic Collision**: Two billiard balls, each with a mass of 0.20 kg, collide. Ball one moves with an initial velocity of 6 m/s, and ball two is initially at rest. After the collision, ball one comes to a complete stop.

* What is the velocity of ball two after the collision?
* What is the total kinetic energy of the combination before the collision?
* What is the total kinetic energy of the combination after the collision?

**Collision in Two Dimensions**: Two objects slide over a frictionless horizontal surface. The first object, mass $$m_1$$ = 5 kg, is propelled with speed $$v_{i1} = 4.5 {\rm m/s}$$ toward the second object, mass $$m_2$$ = 2.5 kg, which is initially at rest. After the collision, both objects have velocities which are directed $$\theta = 30^\circ$$ on either side of the original line of motion of the first object.

* What are the final velocities of the two objects?
* What is the total kinetic energy of the combination before the collision?
* What is the total kinetic energy of the combination after the collision?
* Is the collision elastic or inelastic?
