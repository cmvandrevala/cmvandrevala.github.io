## 🔖 Topics

* Linearization of polynomials
* Linearization of exponentials
* Linearization of logarithms

## 🎯 Objectives

* Describe some of the types of mathematical models
* Discuss why linearization is useful, even when we are able to get equations of best fit that are non-linear
* Transform data so that it is linearized
  * Polynomials
  * Exponentials
  * Logarithms

## 📋 Sequence

* Background on linearization
  * Easier analysis
  * More rigorous interpretation
* How do we do it?
  * There are lots of different techniques that we use
  * Logarithmic transformations
  * Power transformations
  * Polynomial regressions
  * Box-Cox transformations
  * Exponential transformations
* Example of polynomial data set (quadratic)
* Example of exponential data set
* Example of logarithmic data set
