title: Maxwell's Equations
---

## 🔖 Topics

* Displacement current
* Maxwell's equations
* Electromagnetic waves

## 🎯 Objectives

* Explain Maxwell's contributions to electromagnetic theory
* Explain why displacement current is a necessary addition to Ampere's law
* Compile Maxwell's four equations
* Describe some of the uses of Maxwell's equations in electromagnetic theory

## 📋 Sequence

* Maxwell's add-on to Ampere's law
  * Consider a capacitor in a circuit with a long wire
  * Draw an Amperian surface passing between the plates of the capacitor
  * Magnetic fields depend on current AND changing electric field
* Maxwell's equations
  * Gauss's law for electricity - electric field lines emanate / terminate on electric charges
  * Gauss's law for magnetism - magnetic field lines are closed loops (i.e. there are no magnetic charges)
  * Faraday's law of induction - changing magnetic fields produce electric fields
  * Ampere-Maxwell law - changing electric fields and currents produce magnetic fields
