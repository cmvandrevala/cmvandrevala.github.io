title: Faraday's Law of Induction
---

## 🔖 Topics

* Faraday's law of induction
* Lenz's law

## 🎯 Objectives

* Calculate the induced EMF from a changing magnetic flux in a variety of situations
* Use Lenz's law to calculate the direction of the EMF from Faraday's law of induction

## 📋 Sequence

We will be going through a variety of practice problems to showcase Faraday's law of induction and Lenz's law. Specifically, we will cover the cases of changing magnetic field, changing wire loop area, and changing wire loop angle.
