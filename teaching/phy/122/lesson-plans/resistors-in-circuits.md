### Resistors

1. A resistor with a resistance of \\( R = 250 \\: \Omega \\) is connected to a 9 volt battery. What is the current drawn from the battery? What is the power dissipated across the resistor?
2. Four resistors, each with a resistance of \\( 10 \\: \Omega \\) are connected in series along a voltage source of \\( V = 25 \\: V \\). What is the power dissipated in each resistor? What is the total power dissipated in the circuit?
3. Four resistors, each with a resistance of \\( 10 \\: \Omega \\) are connected in parallel along a voltage source of \\( V = 25 \\: V \\). What is the power dissipated in each resistor? What is the total power dissipated in the circuit?
