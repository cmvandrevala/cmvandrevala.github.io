$$
W = \int _{\theta_i}^{\theta_f} \vec{\tau} \cdot d\vec{\theta} = \int _{\theta_i}^{\theta_f} \tau d\theta
$$

The torque is in the opposite direction from increasing $$\theta$$. Thus, we need a negative sign.

$$
W = \int _{\theta_i}^{\theta_f} -(\vec{p} \times \vec{E}) d\theta
$$

$$
W = \int _{\theta_i}^{\theta_f} -pE sin\theta d\theta
$$

$$
W = pE cos\theta_f - pEcos\theta_i
$$

$$
W = pE (cos\theta_f - cos\theta_i)
$$

The change in potential energy is negative work.

$$
U = -W = pE (cos\theta_i - cos\theta_f)
$$

Let's take a baseline at U = 0 J, corresponding to $$\theta_i = 90^\circ$$.

$$
U = -pE cos\theta_f = -\vec{p} \cdot \vec{E}
$$

## üìù Practice Problems

I place an electric dipole with a dipole moment of magnitude 0.005 Cm into an electric field of 1300 N/C. The electric field is pointing in the +y direction.

1. What is the maximum torque on the dipole? At what orientation does this occur?
2. What is the minimum torque on the dipole? At what orientation does this occur?
3. What is the maximum potential energy of the dipole? At what orientation does this occur?
4. What is the minimum potential energy of the dipole? At what orientation does this occur?
