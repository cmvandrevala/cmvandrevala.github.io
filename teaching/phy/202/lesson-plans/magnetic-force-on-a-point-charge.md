## 📝 Practice Problems

1. An ion with a charge of +2.5 mC and an unknown mass moves in a circle of radius 12.5 cm when inside a magnetic field of 1.2 T. If the speed of the ion is 100 m/s, what is the mass of the ion?
2. A uniform magnetic field points vertically upward with a strength of 0.5 T. An electron with kinetic energy \\( 2.5 \times 10^{-18} \\: J \\) is moving horizontally in this field. What is the magnetic force acting on the electron? The mass of an electron is \\( 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \\: kg \\) and the charge on an electron is \\( 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \\: C \\).

## ✅ Partial Solutions

1. 3.75 mg
2. \\( 1.87 \\times 10^{-13} \\: N \\)
