## üéØ Objectives

* Perform dimensional analysis on the base units in SI
* Perform calculations with the correct number of significant figures
* Calculate the side lengths of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem
* Calculate the angles around a right triangle using sine, cosine, and tangent
* Perform basic operations on vectors (addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, etc.)
* Calculate dot and cross products of vectors

## üìã Sequence

* Seven base units in SI
  * Length
  * Time
  * Mass
  * You will learn the rest later
* Converting units
* Dimensional analysis
* Significant figures
  * When multiplying or dividing quantities, the number of significant figures in the final answer is no greater than that in the quantity with the fewest significant figures.
  * When adding or subtracting quantities, the number of decimal places in the answer should match that of the term with the smallest number of decimal places.
* Vectors
  * Addition
  * Subtraction
  * Components
  * Magnitude
  * Unit Vectors
  * Scalar Multiplication
  * Dot Product
  * Cross Product

### Conversions

Make the following unit conversions:

* How many meters is 150 centimeters?
* How many years is 35 teraseconds? Recall that tera- is $$10^{12}$$.
* What is 25 meters per second in miles per hour? Recall that 1.6 km = 1.0 miles

### Significant Figures

Perform the following calculations, using correct significant figures in your answers:

* 3.611825 - 2.22 = ?
* 90.0 + 4.77 = ?
* (23.875)(3.4) = ?
* (100)/(10.0) = ?
