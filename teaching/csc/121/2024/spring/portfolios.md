## Overview

A portfolio is a collection of what you consider your best work to date. It includes assignments that we have completed in class with additional revisions / add-ons and optional opportunities for extra credit. The goal of these portfolios is to package together a few exemplary pieces of work rather than dozens of disconnected assignments. You might even consider using these portfolios as a showcase of some of your work in a professional setting.

Each portfolio is divided into three parts.

1. Lab Corrections (Optional)
2. Portfolio Add-Ons (Required)
3. Extra Credit (Optional)

### Lab Corrections

Over the course of the semester, I try to give detailed feedback on what was incorrect about a particular problem done in lab. This is your chance to go back, correct those mistakes, and earn some points back!

You can go back and correct any mistakes that you made on problems included in the portfolio. There are no restrictions on how many problems you can correct. You can choose to correct zero or go back and correct every problem included in the portfolio. Do not start the problem over from scratch. Instead, make changes to your original code and submit them as part of your portfolio.

You can earn back up to half of the lost points on a problem.

### Portfolio Add-Ons

At the bottom of each problem given in lab is a set of add-ons for the portfolio, each with a "credit" value. You are expected to complete 16 credits worth of add-ons for the portfolio. Do not start the problem over from scratch. Instead, make additions / changes to your original code and submit them as part of your portfolio.

Each add-onÂ to a lab is given a credit score to indicate approximately how difficult it is. Roughly speaking, one credit is easy, two credits is moderate, and three or more credits is difficult. It is your choice which problems / credits you want to complete (e.g. you can do 16 "one-credit" add-ons, ten "two-credit" add-ons, or any combination that adds up to 16).

It is highly recommended that if you decide to do portfolio add-ons for a given problem, you first do lab corrections for that problem (if applicable). Trying to add code onto an existing, incorrect solution is likely to result in more incorrect work.

### Extra Credit

When you hand in your portfolio, you have the option to complete some work for extra credit. There is no penalty for skipping extra credit on a portfolio. However, you cannot "go back" and do extra credit for a previous portfolio.

Extra credit is an opportunity to explore topics in computer science / programming that you find interesting. At least one week before the portfolio is due, sync with me in class to discuss a topic and the accompanying work for your extra credit. Once I approve your idea, you are free to work on the extra credit for your portfolio.

Some ideas for extra credit include (but are not limited to):

* Write a one page paper on a major figure in computer science
* Repeat one of the lab assignments with a programming language other than C++
* Write the code for a famous / useful algorithm
* Work on a personal software project that you find meaningful
* Complete additional add-on credits, over the minimum requirement of ten

## Handing In Portfolios

There are three portfolios due over the course of the semester. For each portfolio, create a Word or PDF document that contains the following:

1. A cover sheet that describes which assignments you corrected, which add-ons you attempted, and the topic of your extra credit (if applicable).
2. All of your code samples

## Grading

Lab corrections allow you to earn points back on the problems that we worked on during labs. If you do any lab corrections, I will score the lab again and then give you half the points earned back on the lab.

I will use the same standard to grade add-ons as I do the original labs themselves.

You can earn up to 5% credit on a portfolio if you complete the extra credit assignment. The theoretical maximum score on a portfolio is 105%.
