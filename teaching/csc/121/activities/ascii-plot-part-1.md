## 🎯 Problem Statement

Write a program that allows a user to input an x and y coordinate. Then, plot that coordinate on the console by drawing a set of axes via ASCII characters.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

* A user should be able to enter the x and y coordinates of a point (each will be an integer greater than zero).
* The output should include a set of axes as well as the plotted point.

## 📋 Dev Notes

* You don't have to worry about plotting points along the x-axis or y-axis. This means that you can always assume that the x and y coordinates of the point are greater than zero.
* You can assume that the x and y coordinates will always be positive integers.
* You do not need to write any validation of the inputted coordinates.

## 🖥️ Example Output

```bash
./plot.out

Enter the x-coordinate that you want to plot: 5
Enter the y-coordinate that you want to plot: 2
