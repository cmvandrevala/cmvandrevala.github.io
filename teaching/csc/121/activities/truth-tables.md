## 🔖 Background Information

A truth table is a tool that we can use to determine all of the possible outcomes of a boolean function {% cite beziauHistoryTruthValues2012 %}. In this activity, we will practice writing out some truth tables.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Suppose that A, B, and C are boolean variables.

Write out the truth tables for the following expressions:

```text
1. A && B && C
2. (A && B) || (A && C)
3. !A || (B && !C)
4. !A || (A && !B) || (A && !C)
5. !A || !B || !C
```

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

* Create a truth table for each of the problems outlined in the problem statement.
* You might find it useful to create a few extra columns that allow you to break down the solution into smaller steps.
