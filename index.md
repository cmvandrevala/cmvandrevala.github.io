Hello! Here is a little bit about myself.

I grew up in the north suburbs of Chicago and attended Marquette University as an undergraduate student. There, I earned a dual major in biomedical engineering and physics. After my time at Marquette, I went to graduate school at Purdue University where I earned my Ph.D. in physics, focusing on education and computational science. After graduate school, I worked in the private sector as a software consultant at [8th Light](https://8thlight.com/) and as a developer at a healthcare company called [Flare Health](https://flarehealth.com/).

Recently, I decided to re-enter the field of teaching as a faculty member at [Harper College](https://www.harpercollege.edu/index.php). I have had the chance to teach a variety of classes including physics, computer science, and computer information systems. It has been a lot of fun to get back in the classroom again!

I am interested in physics education, computer science education, and quantum computing as areas of exploration.
