That intuitive approach, combined with consistent problem-solving strategies, stunning art, extensive end-of-chapter material, and superior digital support make this a product that addresses the needs of today's students. The Fifth Edition adds more applications to real-life, more problems, and highlights support for math skills needed for physics.  Online Labs for Physics is now also included in the Connect offering for this title! Online Labs for Physics is a fully-online lab experience that can be used as an online lab replacement, preparation, supplement or make-up lab to bridge the gap between lab and lecture. These simulations help a student learn the practical and conceptual skills needed, then check for understanding and provide feedback. With pre-lab and post-lab assessment available and editable, instructors can customize each assignment within Connect.},
